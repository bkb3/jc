# Journal club presentation (June 5th, 2020)

These are the slides for my Journal Club presentation. All demonstrations (phase separation at [slide 2](https://bkb3.github.io/jc/#/1) and liquid like behaviour at [slide 10](https://bkb3.github.io/jc/#/9)) was done by me to illustrate the points. 

This presentation was based on the paper ["Identifying sequence perturbations to an intrinsically disordered protein that determine its phase-separation behavior"](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/21/11421).
